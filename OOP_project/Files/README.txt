
~  This project involves a simple RPG turn-based game through the command line, developed in C++.
  Up to three heroes can be spawned in the game world, a Warrior a Paladin or a Sorcerer each one 
  with his special tilt. The game's world is based on a grid where our heroes move in search of gold
  fame and epic battles.
   By exploring the grid our heroes can battle the monsters that lurk in some areas or even find a market 
  to upgrade their gear, buy potions and discover spells to use in their advantage. After each battle that
  the heroes have won, they will be granted experience points so as to raise their statistics but also an 
  amount of gold to use in the market. A battle can be triggered by moving to  a common square in the grid
  and the market by moving to a market square respectively.
   A hero's equipment consists of a weapon and an armor, the first is used to deal damage while the second
  to decrease the damage received. Also, a hero can carry potions that either restore health or mana, or 
  grant the hero a buff to boost his damage, defence or agility for an amount of turns. A hero can also 
  use powerful spells against his enemies that put a buff on each monster he attacks decreasing a certain
  stat for a couple of turns. In addition, each hero type (Warrior-Paladin-Sorcerer) has his own advantage
  concerning his statistics. Moreover, a Warrior has a boosted attack, a Paladin a boosted health while a
  Sorcerer can use spells more efficiently than the other heroes.
